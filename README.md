# Software-Engineering-Project
A project for CSIS343. We did not focus on design(CSS related design). We focused on reusing code and connecting our site to a database. The version of PHP we used is an old version now. My part of the project was the PHP part(connecting to DB, posting content to DB, pulling from DB, etc.)
